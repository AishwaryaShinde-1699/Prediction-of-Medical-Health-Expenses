# Prediction-of-Medical-Health-Expenses

- I have completed Project on prediction of medical health expenses and in this project to predict the future medical health expenses.
- The Dataset I am using is Medical Health Expense Dataset it consists of 1338 rows and 7 columns.

**Aim of the Project:** 
From the given dataset we have to predict future medical health expenses.

**Steps involved to build the model:**   
1. Exploratory Data Analysis. 
2. Feature Engineering. 
3. Model Building. 
4. Compare Models. 

**Conclusion:**
- We came to know that the Most Important Factor to Predict the Medical Expenses of a subject is
Smoking Behavior and Age, that means, smoking is Bad for Health, as already know that and which
inevitably increases medical expenses as due to smoking one is likely to fall ill more than the
nonsmokers.
- We also found that with increasing of age, one needs to take some more care and precautions for your
health as with the increase of age health becomes fragile so they go for frequent medical check-up,
likely to fall ill quickly as with the increase of age immunity falls so they adopt measures to stay
healthy by taking medicines and engaging in some physical activities like jogging, walking, Yoga
which causes an increase of medical expenses.
- We have built three models among which the Gradient Boosting Regressor model shows the best
result through which we can say 83.8% variability of expenses can well be explained by predictor
variables and which yields comparatively low RMSE value so our predicted expense through this
model will not vary too much from the actual expense.
